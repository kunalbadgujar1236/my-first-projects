### Simple Questions on Variables in # Program:

#1. **What is a variable in # Program:?**
# - **Answer:** A variable is a name that holds a value. It can store numbers, text, or other data.

#2. **How do you make a variable in # Program:?**
# - **Answer:** You create a variable by giving it a name and a value. For example: `x = 10`.

#3. **Can a variable name start with a number in # Program:?**
# - **Answer:** No, a variable name cannot start with a number. It must start with a letter or an underscore (_).

#4. **What are the rules for naming variables in # Program:?**
# - **Answer:** Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore, can have letters, numbers, and underscores, and cannot use reserved words like `if` or `while`.

#5. **What will be the result of this code?**
 # Program:
x = 5
y = x + 3
x = x + 2
print(x, y)
 
# - **Answer:** The result will be `7 8`.

#6. **How do you swap the values of two variables without using a third variable?**
# - **Answer:** You can swap values like this:
 # Program:
x, y = y, x
 

#7. **What is the difference between local and global variables?**
# - **Answer:** Local variables are created inside a function and can only be used there. Global variables are created outside all functions and can be used anywhere in the code.

#8. **What is variable shadowing?**
# - **Answer:** Variable shadowing happens when a local variable has the same name as a global variable. The local variable hides the global one within its scope.

#9. **Can you change the value of a global variable inside a function? How?**
# - **Answer:** Yes, you can change a global variable inside a function using the `global` keyword.
 # Program:
global x
x = 10
 

#10. **What will be the result of this code?**
 
def func():
  global a
  a = 10
  a = 5
func()
print(a)
  
 # - **Answer:** The result will be `10`.

#11. **How do you delete a variable in # Program:?**
 # - **Answer:** You delete a variable using the `del` statement.
 
del x
  

#12. **What will be the result of this code?**
 
x = 10
def func():
  x = 5
  print(x)
func()
print(x)
  
 # - **Answer:** The result will be `5 10`.

#13. **Can you assign multiple values to multiple variables in one line? Give an example.**
 # - **Answer:** Yes, you can do it like this:
 
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
  

#14. **What is a constant in # Program:, and how do you define one?**
 # - **Answer:** A constant is a variable whose value should not change. You use uppercase letters to define it.
 
 PI = 3.14
  

#15. **What will be the result of this code?**
 
 x = [1, 2, 3]
 y = x
 y.append(4)
 print(x)
  
 # - **Answer:** The result will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

#16. **What is mutability in # Program:?**
 # - **Answer:** Mutability means if you can change an object after it is created. Lists and dictionaries are mutable, but strings and tuples are not.

#17. **What will be the result of this code?**
 
 x = "Hello"
 def func():
  x = x + " World"
  print(x)
 func()
  
 # - **Answer:** This code will cause an error because `x` is used before it is assigned a new value inside the function.

#18. **How do you create a variable that holds a list?**
 # - **Answer:** You can create it like this:
 
 my_list = [1, 2, 3]
  

#19. **What is the scope of a variable?**
 # - **Answer:** The scope of a variable is the part of the program where it can be used. Variables can have a local scope (inside functions) or a global scope (outside functions).

#20. **What will be the result of this code?**
 
 x = 10
 def func():
  global x
  x = x + 5
 func()
 print(x)
  
 # - **Answer:** The result will be `15`.

### Complex Questions on Variables in Simple Language

#21. **What is the difference between `is` and `==`? Give an example.**
 # - **Answer:** `==` checks if two values are the same. `is` checks if two variables point to the same object in memory.
 
 a = [1, 2, 3]
 b = [1, 2, 3]
 print(a == b)  # True
 print(a is b)  # False
  

#22. **What is variable aliasing? Give an example and explain any problems it might cause.**
 # - **Answer:** Variable aliasing happens when two variables point to the same object. Changes to one variable affect the other.
 
 x = [1, 2, 3]
 y = x
 y.append(4)
 print(x)  # Output will be [1, 2, 3, 4]
  

#23. **What is the LEGB rule?**
 # - **Answer:** LEGB stands for Local, Enclosing, Global, Built# -in. It is the order in which # Program: looks for variables.
 
 x = 'global'
 def outer():
  x = 'enclosing'
  def inner():
x = 'local'
print(x)
  inner()
 outer()
  

#24. **What is a closure? How do variables work within a closure?**
 # - **Answer:** A closure is a function inside another function that remembers the outer function's variables.
 
 def outer_func(x):
  def inner_func(y):
return x + y
  return inner_func

 add_five = outer_func(5)
 print(add_five(10))  # Output will be 15
  

#25. **What is the difference between `deepcopy` and `shallow copy`? Give an example.**
 # - **Answer:** A shallow copy copies references to the objects, while a deep copy copies the objects themselves.
 
 import copy

 original = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
 shallow = copy.copy(original)
 deep = copy.deepcopy(original)

 original[2].append(5)
 print(original)  # Output: [1, 2, [3, 4, 5]]
 print(shallow)# Output: [1, 2, [3, 4, 5]]
 print(deep)# Output: [1, 2, [3, 4]]
  

#26. **How do you create a constant in # Program:? Can you make sure it does not change?**
 # - **Answer:** You can create a constant by using uppercase letters, but # Program: cannot enforce it to not change.
 
 PI = 3.14
  

#27. **How does # Program:'s garbage collection work?**
 # - **Answer:** # Program: uses reference counting and garbage collection to manage memory. When an object has no references, it gets deleted.
 
 import gc

 class Node:
  def __init__(self, value):
self.value = value
self.next = None

 def create_cycle():
  a = Node(1)
  b = Node(2)
  a.next = b
  b.next = a

 create_cycle()
 gc.collect()  # Explicitly trigger garbage collection
  

#28. **What is the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) and how does it affect multi# -threading?**
 # - **Answer:** The GIL allows only one thread to execute at a time in a # Program: process. This can slow down multi# -threaded programs that are CPU# -bound.
 
 import threading

 def task():
  global counter
  for _ in range(100000):
counter += 1

 counter = 0
 threads = [threading.Thread(target=task) for _ in range(10)]
 for t in threads:
  t.start()
 for t in threads:
  t.join()
 print(counter)  # Output may be less than expected due to the GIL
  

#29. **How does # Program: handle variable scopes in nested functions? Give an example.**
 # - **Answer:** # Program: follows the LEGB rule for variable scope in nested functions.
 
 def outer():
  x = 'outer'
  def inner():
nonlocal x
x = 'inner'
print(x)
  inner()
  print(x)

 outer()
  

#30. **What are `nonlocal` and `global` keywords? Give examples.**
 # - **Answer

#:** `nonlocal` is used to refer to variables in the nearest enclosing scope. `global` is used to refer to variables in the global scope.
 
 def outer():
  x = 'outer'
  def inner():
nonlocal x
x = 'inner'
  inner()
  print(x)  # Output: inner

 outer()

 y = 'global'
 def func():
  global y
  y = 'modified'
 func()
 print(y)  # Output: modified
